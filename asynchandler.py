#This script will need the following parts to function properly:
# - Definitions for ws_reader, ws_writer, device_proxy, and periodic_ping coroutines.
# - An asyncio event loop to run the handle_ws coroutine with appropriate WebSocket and device_id parameters.
# - Proper error handling and logging as needed for production use.
